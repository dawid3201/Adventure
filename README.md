# Adventure
A simple game that was a challenge during my online course on Udemy platform. Here I learned how to use HashMaps. 
The game requires you to use buttons Q,W,E,S and N which are equal to Quit, West, South, East and North. 

We can press Q at any time which will cause the program to stop.
At the beginning we can press any button and each direction has different exits.

For example, after choosing W at the beginning we can only go N or Quit the game.
